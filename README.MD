# Discounted and not actively maintained anymore
## This is the early stage of ASPF and it had a great success, but PHP is not suitable for this massive socket operations
## ASPF completely rewritten into Kinga Framework which is our C/C++ multiplatform(OSX,*NIX,WINDOWS) and squirrel scriptable framework which can replace PHP and solved massive network operations by async nonblocking sockets and able to use MILTER interface.
## So ASPF-Milter born and handles thousands of emails with 99% filter rate, uses new technology like, only greylist when necessary and can detect botnet activity also mail headers processing available, builtin webserver and very low footprint on memory and CPU.
##
## There is a plan to release the new ASPF Code, but Kinga Framework is not OSS product at the moment

# ASPF
## Advanced SPAM Processing Filter

### Workflow
- Written in PHP, Compatible with PHP5 and above included PHP7.1
- The software listens on TCP 10099 (both INET4 and INET6)
- Analyze SMTP Fields then register action in mySQL database
- Only need to add content policy to inet:127.0.0.1:10099 or [::1]:10099 (on postfix)
- This software not processing any content of mails, just playing with SMTP fields
- There several SPAM filtering levels which can be adjusted on the config or from webadmin
- This Package includes webadmin
- Enterprise Class Centralized Statistics from mail sending and receiving operations
- Supports: Postfix, Exim
- Tested on Debian based Linux and FreeBSD: (For compat, you may need symlink /usr/local/bin/php -> /usr/bin/php)

### Features
- Statistics
- Whitelist address / domain Based
- Blacklist address / domain Based
- Sending Limits address / domain Based
- Graylist operation (Auto-Learn)
- Configurable RBL Lists / per server
- Configurable SPAM Detection algorythm / per server / address / domain


### How to Install
#### Linux:
- Extract this package in /opt init scripts are included
- Setup mySQL Database (included) and mySQL account
- Configure with **aspf.conf**
- Copy init script to /etc/init.d
- Then run: **update-rc.d aspf_linux defaults**
- Start the script: **service aspf_linux start**
- Create a PHP VirtualHost for ASPF Webadmin then log-in

#### FreeBSD:
- Extract this package in /opt init scripts are icluded
- Setup mySQL Database (included) and mySQL account
- Configure with **aspf.conf**
- Copy init script to /usr/local/etc/rc.d then rename it to aspf
- Add to rc.conf or rc.conf.d **aspf_enable="YES"**
- Start the script: **service aspf start**
- Create a PHP VirtualHost for ASPF Webadmin
